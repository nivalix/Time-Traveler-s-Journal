    <div class="cultural-snapshot">
      <p>I attended a royal concert at the Schönbrunn Palace last evening — what an extraordinary affair! 
        The orchestra was positioned in the center of the grand ballroom, surrounded by nobility in their finest attire. 
        Mozart was conducting, his small stature belying his commanding presence. When the music began, it was as if time stood still. 
        The candlelight flickered in perfect harmony with the delicate melodies that floated through the air. 
        I noticed the Empress herself with eyes closed, completely transported by the beauty of it all.</p>

    <div class="cultural-snapshot">
      <p>Beethoven performed at Count Razumovsky's salon tonight. 
        Such passion! Such fury! He hunched over the pianoforte like a man possessed, his fingers moving with supernatural speed. 
        The audience sat in stunned silence, some appeared unsettled by the emotional intensity of the piece. 
        When he finished, he stood abruptly, gave a curt bow, and left without a word. 
        The Count later told me the maestro is growing increasingly deaf — how tragic that such a musical genius can no longer fully hear his own magnificent creations.</p>
